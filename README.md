## üí± **How Enhanced Currency Conversion Works**

The application now provides comprehensive historical analysis:

1. **Individual Payment Conversion**: Each payment can be converted individually using historical rates
2. **Historical Rate Fetching**: Retrieves exchange rates for specific investment dates
3. **Rate Change Tracking**: Compares investment date rates with current rates
4. **Investment Conversion**: Converts your investment amount to the property currency using historical rates
5. **Interest Calculation**: Applies compound interest in the property currency over time
6. **Final Conversion**: Converts the future value back to your investment currency using current live rates
7. **Impact Analysis**: Shows the difference between currency-adjusted returns and theoretical returns

### **Enhanced Formula Breakdown:**
```
Step 1: Historical Rate Fetch = Yahoo Finance Historical API Call (Investment Date)
Step 2: Individual Payment Conversion = Amount √ó Historical Exchange Rate
Step 3: Investment Amount (Property Currency) = Investment Amount √ó Historical Rate
Step 4: Future Value (Property Currency) = Investment Amount (Property) √ó (1 + Rate)^Time
Step 5: Current Rate Fetch = Yahoo Finance Live API Call
Step 6: Future Value (Investment Currency) = Future Value (Property) √ó Current Live Rate
Step 7: Rate Change Analysis = Current Rate - Historical Rate
Step 8: Currency Impact = Actual Returns - Theoretical Returns (No Currency Change)
```

## üìä **Example Scenarios with Historical Tracking**

### **Scenario 1: USD to AED Investment with Historical Rates**
- Invest $10,000 USD on January 15, 2023
- Property generates returns in AED
- **Historical Rate (Jan 15, 2023)**: 1 USD = 3.6725 AED
- **Current Rate (Today)**: 1 USD = 3.6730 AED
- **Rate Change**: +0.0005 (+0.01%)
- **Result**: Historical conversion + rate change analysis

### **Scenario 2: EUR to GBP Investment with Date-Specific Conversion**
- Invest ‚Ç¨8,000 EUR on March 10, 2022
- Property generates returns in GBP
- **Historical Rate (Mar 10, 2022)**: 1 EUR = 0.8345 GBP
- **Current Rate (Today)**: 1 EUR = 0.8567 GBP
- **Rate Change**: +0.0222 (+2.66%)
- **Result**: Significant EUR appreciation vs GBP over time
